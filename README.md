## üó£Ô∏è About

> Push_swap is a sorting algorithm implemented in C. It efficiently sorts a stack of intengers using a series of predefined operations.

<p>
Before reviewing my code, I strongly advise against analyzing it in its current state. It's quite disorganized, reflecting my early attempts at tackling the Pushswap project. While it may not be a masterpiece of code, it serves as a starting point for my learning journey.
</p>
<p>
<strong>Don't worry, though</strong>. At the end of this file, I'll share some solutions that helped me successfully complete the project. Additionally, I've included detailed documentation that I found to be very helpful in understanding and improving my code.

	<b><i>The project objectives ‚úçÔ∏è</i></b><br>
</p>

<p align="center">
    Basicaly we have two stacks (don`t worry if you don`t understand any concept or word yet, they`ll be explained later on) <i>A</i> and <i>B</i> then we gonna create a program that implemnts a sorting algorithm which will use those two stacks to <strong><i>sort</i></strong> the stacks.
</p>

| Stacks |   A   |   B   |
| :---:  | :---: | :---: |
|        |  -38  |       |
|        |   10  |       |
|        |   7   |       |
|        |   42  |       |

<p>
    Our program works this way:
</p>

```console
./push_swap -38 10 7 42
```

<p>
    <code style="color: cyan">./push_swap</code> is our program
</p>
<br>
<p>
    <code style="color: orange">38 10 7 42</code> is our input
</p>
<br>
<p>
     <code style="color: cyan">./push_swap</code> take this input, use the implemented sorting algorithm and return a value (this value is the amount of used operations to sort the values)
</p>
<br>

## Operations ? ‚öôÔ∏è

- what are these <strong>operations</strong> ?

We have a pre-set of operations to use. they are:

- swap
- rotate
- reverse rotate
- push

### ok, but. How do i use all this information ?

Well. Now thigs will start make some sense. Let`s see step by step.

remember these numbers <code>38 10 7 42</code> let`s see our program working and you will understand why we started talking about all of that.

let`s run our program

```console
./push_swap 38 10 7 42
pb
sa
pa
```
pb, sa, pa?

### first let`s take a look at our starting point (our stacks)

| Stacks |   A   |   B   |
| :---:  | :---: | :---: |
|        |  -38  |       |
|        |   10  |       |
|        |   7   |       |
|        |   42  |       |

### now we`re going to see each operation of our program(pb, sa, pa)

1. <strong>pb</strong> stands for <strong>push B</strong> so our first operation in our program is push our first value to stack b

| Stacks |   A   |   B   |
| :---:  | :---: | :---: |
|        |   ->  |  -38  |
|        |   10  |       |
|        |   7   |       |
|        |   42  |       |

2. Next operation is <strong>sa</strong> which is <strong>swap A</strong>. Gonna swap the first two items of <strong>stack A</strong>:

<table>
<tr><th>Before Swap A</th><th>After Swap A</th></tr>
<tr><td>

| Stacks |   A   |   B   |
|--------|-------|-------|
|        |       |  -38  |
|   ->   |   10  |       |
|   ->   |   7   |       |
|        |   42  |       |

</td><td>

| Stacks |   A   |   B   |
|--------|-------|-------|
|        |       |  -38  |
|        |   7   |       |
|        |   10  |       |
|        |   42  |       |

</td></tr> </table>

3. Now lets see our last operation happening; <strong>PA</strong> which stands for <strong>Push A</strong>

<table>
<tr><th>Before Push A</th><th>After Push A</th></tr>
<tr><td>

| Stacks |   A   |   B   |
|--------|-------|-------|
|        |       |  -38  |
|        |   7   |       |
|        |   10  |       |
|        |   42  |       |

</td><td>

| Stacks |   A   |   B   |
|--------|-------|-------|
|        |   -38 |       |
|        |   7   |       |
|        |   10  |       |
|        |   42  |       |

</td></tr> </table>

Our stack A at the beginning was

```console
-38 10 7 42
```

Now is

```console
-38 7 10 42
```

It is in ascending order! that`s what we wanted to have.

<br>
Now go back to the beginning of our program running to wach again each step.

## Ok, what now?

Well, now you need to start code. What i recommend:
Start with the stack_a creation, receive the args, transform them into values and place into the stack - I did this using linked list (to be honest i don`t know yet if there is another solution than linked lists).

Its everything working properly? 

- Yes:

So start building te functions in the subject (push, swap, rotate [...]) and don't forget to test them a lot with your stack_a. That's a good starting point and it will take a lot of time to do all of that, but you`ll understand the main concept of Push_swap after that.

## recapitulating ‚úçÔ∏è

- Our program will receive intengers.
- will take these intengers and use both stacks <strong>A</strong> and <strong>B</strong> to put them in ascending order
- will use the operations provided in the subject (pa, pb, sa, sb...) to order them.

This sould give you a god starting point to create your own push_swap. Remember, you wi`ll implement a sorting algorithm to use both stacks do what you have to. Try by your own, then come back here i you need to watch the next steps. I will update this README to help everyone. don not forget to give me a ‚≠ê<strong>Star</strong>
